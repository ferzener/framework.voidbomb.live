# framework.voidbomb.live
I just want the simplest and dumbest PHP framework possible.

# mission 1
- [ ] Create table access_count and for each access on the main page add a new entry on the database.

# Rule
1. Solid objects: a page should be a page. (examples, home : index.php, profile : profile.php ...) let's call it filesystem routing.
2. Have logic consumption per page, no deep abstractions.
- A page can be a complement of the page before or a new world
- A directory can be a completly new application or just a route... who knows??
